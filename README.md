# Weather React App

The Weather React App is a web application built with React that provides users with current weather details for a specific location. Users can enter a city name or select their location to get real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

## Features

- Current weather details display: The app fetches weather data from a weather API and displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the selected location.
- Location search: Users can search for weather details by entering a city name in the search bar. The app retrieves the weather information for the specified location.
- Geolocation support: If the user grants permission, the app uses geolocation to automatically detect the user's current location and displays the weather details accordingly.
- Responsive design: The app is designed to be responsive and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

To run the Weather React App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xmartcoder/Weather-React-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Weather-React-App
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace the placeholder with your API key. You can obtain an API key from a weather data provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the app.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Weather data provider API for fetching current weather information.

## Future Enhancements

- Extended weather forecast: Include a forecast feature to display weather predictions for the upcoming days.
- Unit conversion: Add an option to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit).
- Weather icons: Integrate weather icons to visually represent the weather conditions.
- Historical weather data: Implement a feature to retrieve historical weather data for a specific date.
